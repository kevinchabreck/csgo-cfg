# csgo-cfg
A collection of scripts for configuring personalized binds and settings for Counter Strike: Global Offensive

## Usage
1. Move the [`profile.cfg`](./profile.cfg) file and the [`csgo-cfg`](./csgo-cfg) subdirectory into your csgo config directory (the devs update the path from time to time, so I won't include it here).
2. After launching the game, execute the `profile` script

    ```exec profile```
